# react-dev-playground
February 18, 2026

With 7–8 months of prior experience working in real-world project, I am revisiting the library to strengthen my architectural understanding and refine my frontend development practices.

This phase focuses on building structured projects while deepening my understanding of:

Component-driven architecture

State management patterns

Re-rendering behavior and reconciliation

UI consistency and scalable design systems

Performance optimization techniques

The goal is not to relearn React, but to master it — by writing cleaner, more predictable, and production-ready code.
This repository focuses on implementing scalable frontend architecture patterns and refining engineering practices through real-world project development.
I am planning to sit today all day and understand the working flow of ui so i can visually better the architecture pattern of any system from basics
